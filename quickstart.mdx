## Get Started with Mallory

Follow these steps to start using Mallory.

### Step 1: Sign in or sign up

Access Mallory at [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai). Sign in with your account or create one if you're new.

### Step 2: Explore your feed and stories

Your **feed** shows customized stories—curated threat intelligence tailored to what matters to you. To see all stories (not just your feed), go to **Monitor** → **Stories** in the app. Use these views to stay on top of new threats and vulnerabilities.

### Step 3: Try Agent Threads

Use **Agent Threads** to ask questions in natural language. You can query entities, relationships, and recent activity to investigate threats and generate insights.

### Step 4: Browse library

Go to **Library** to explore **entities** (threat actors, malware, vulnerabilities, organizations) and **observables** (IOCs such as IPs, domains, hashes). Entity pages show details, aliases, and related intelligence; observables show assessments and linked entities.
