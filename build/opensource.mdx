## Build (Open Source)

Mallory publishes several projects as open source so you can integrate threat intelligence into your workflows, automation, and AI tools.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**API client**](/build/api/sdk/python) | Official Python client (malloryapi) for the Mallory API. Typed, resource-based interface for vulnerabilities, threat actors, malware, stories, and more. [GitHub](https://github.com/malloryai/malloryapi) |
| [**MCP server**](/use/agent/mcp) | Exposes Mallory's API as MCP tools for Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP clients. [GitHub](https://github.com/malloryai/mallorymcp) |
| [**Asset Query**](https://github.com/malloryai/assetquery) | Asset discovery and context for vulnerability and escalation workflows. |
| [**Claude Code plugins**](/use/agent/claude_code) | Mallory plugin and marketplace for Claude Code: mallory-api skill, adversary emulation, vulnerability escalation, and more. [GitHub](https://github.com/malloryai/marketplace) |

All of these use your [Mallory API key](/build/api/auth) for authentication. Repositories are under the [malloryai](https://github.com/malloryai) organization on GitHub.
