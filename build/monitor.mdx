## Monitor Trending

Just as in the UX, you can use the API to get **trending** entities, **trending IOCs** (observables), and **trending stories** for dashboards, feeds, or alerts.

### Trending entities

Entity list endpoints (e.g. `/v1/actors`, `/v1/vulnerabilities`, `/v1/malware`, `/v1/organizations`) support a **sort** parameter with a trending window. Use `sort=trending_Nd` where `N` is the number of days.

| Sort value   | Window   |
|-------------|---------|
| `trending_1d`  | Last 24 hours |
| `trending_7d`  | Last 7 days    |
| `trending_30d` | Last 30 days   |

Example: vulnerabilities trending over the last 7 days, descending:

```
GET /v1/vulnerabilities?sort=trending_7d&order=desc&limit=20
```

Combine with **filter** or other query parameters as needed. See [Search & filter syntax](/build/search-syntax) and the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for each endpoint’s parameters.

### Trending IOCs (observables)

For **observables** (IOCs), “trending” is driven by recency and how many **opinions** (source assessments) an observable has. To get trending IOCs:

1. **Recency** – Filter or sort by when observables were created or updated (e.g. `created_at` or `updated_at`).
2. **Opinion count** – Use the API to list observables and sort or filter by the number of opinions (e.g. `opinions_count` where supported), so observables with more source opinions rank higher.

Exact parameter names and availability are in the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) under **Observables** (e.g. `GET /v1/observables`, `GET /v1/opinions`, `GET /v1/opinions/grouped`).

### Trending stories

For **stories**, “trending” is based on how many **references** back each story. Sort the stories list by reference count (e.g. `references_count` in descending order) to get the most cited stories first.

Example:

```
GET /v1/stories?sort=references_count&order=desc&limit=20
```

Check the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for the exact sort field name and any filters (e.g. date, topic).
