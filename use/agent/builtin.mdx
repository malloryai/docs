## Using Mallory on the Web

The web app is the **primary and most well-supported** way to use the Mallory agent. The **Mallory agent** in the app is a cybersecurity expert that uses Mallory intelligence and optional web search. You chat with it in threads, and it can run tools to search entities, fetch details, generate reports, and set up scheduled delivery.



### What you can do

- **Search** – Find vulnerabilities, threat actors, malware, attack patterns, breaches, and references; search the knowledge base by concept.
- **Fetch** – Open entity or reference pages by URL and show details in the thread.
- **Reports** – Generate recent-vulnerabilities and recent-threat-actors reports; send to email or Slack.
- **Scheduling** – Configure scheduled reports (e.g. daily or weekly) with delivery to email or Slack.
- **Other** – Ingest new URLs into the knowledge base, run tabletop scenarios, compare entity versions (semantic diff), or call the API via a generic query tool.

### Where to use it

Use the built-in agent from **chat/threads** in the app (e.g. [app.mallory.ai](https://app.mallory.ai)). Web search can be toggled per thread so the agent can use live web results or only Mallory data.

## Tools

The built-in agent uses the following tools (from `web/src/mastra/tools/`):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **web-search** | Latest cybersecurity news, CVEs, and threat actor activity (optional; can be disabled per thread). |
| **search-embeddings** | Semantic search over the Mallory knowledge base (docs, reports, concepts). |
| **search-vulnerabilities** | Find CVEs by keyword, description, or filters (e.g. CVSS, EPSS, trending). |
| **find-affected-products** | List products and versions affected by a CVE; understand blast radius. |
| **search-entities** | Find entities by name: vulnerabilities, threat actors, malware, products, organizations, attack patterns, stories. |
| **search-attack-patterns** | Look up MITRE ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques; see related threat actors and malware. |
| **search-breaches** | Search breach entities and related organizations. |
| **fetch-entity** | Load a single entity (vulnerability, actor, story, exploit, product, advisory, malware, organization, attack pattern, observable) by app URL. |
| **fetch-reference** | Load a reference (article/report) by Mallory reference URL. |
| **ingest-reference** | Submit a URL for ingestion into the knowledge base. |
| **tabletop-scenario** | Generate tabletop exercise scenarios for training. |
| **generate-recent-vulnerabilities-report** | Report of recently mentioned vulnerabilities (e.g. last 24–72 hours). |
| **generate-recent-threat-actors-report** | Report of recently mentioned threat actors (e.g. last 24–72 hours). |
| **semantic-diff** | Compare two versions of an entity or two search result sets for meaningful changes. |
| **query-api** | Run a generic request against the Mallory API. |
| **Schedule tools** | **open-schedule-settings**, **set-schedule-form-values**, **create-schedule** – configure and create scheduled report delivery (email/Slack). |
